# Earth Observation Data Scientist

The objective of this test is to evaluate the candidate’s ability working with Python and Geospatial data. You are asked to build a Python Notebook to assess the impact of floodings during the [Gloria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Gloria) storm (**Januray 15th-25th, 2020**) in an area of interest of your choosing inside the [Maresme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maresme) county along the [Tordera](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tordera_(river)>) river (Catalonia, Spain).

You are asked to produce at least one of the following analytics:

1. Number of square kilometers affected by the floodings.
2. The affected population.
3. The affected roads.

You must use satellite imagery in your analysis (consider using free Sentinel data) for point 1 and combine the results with open data for points 2 and 3. Aspects such as code readability, appealing visualizations and reproducibility will be highly valued.

Please, provide a link to a Github repository with your solution. Describe your solution in the notebook in detail, explaining your choices and trade-offs made. Be creative and don’t hesitate to show off your skills!

If you have any doubt, send an email to careers@earthpulse.es.
